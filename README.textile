h1. Data Bank

Ever want to save data for later, but don't want the overhead of a database, or parsing large files into objects?  With the data bank you can store an object in the same file as the defined class.  Data Bank is just a little hack I tried out to learn how to marshal data.

<pre>
  <code>
    require 'data_bank'
    
    class MyObject
      attr_accessor :data
      
      def initialize(data)
        @data = data
      end
    end
    
    my_object = DataBank.withdraw || MyObject.new(1)
    my_object.data += 1
    puts my_object.data
    DataBank.deposit my_object
  </code>
</pre>
